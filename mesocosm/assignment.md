**AIM:** Setting up sealed mesocosms to try to establish sustainability. (Practical 5) Mesocosms are small experimental areas that are set up as ecological experiments. Fenced-­‐off enclosures in grassland or forests could be used as terrestrial mesocosms; tanks set up in the laboratory can be used as aquatic mesocosms.
Ecological experiments can be done in replicate mesocosms, to find out the effects of varying one or more conditions. For example, tanks could be set up with and without fish, to investigate the effects of fish on aquatic ecosystems.
Another possible use of mesocosms is to test what types of ecosystems are sustainable. This involves sealing up a community or organisms together with air and soil or water inside a container.

**Research Question:** What elements are needed to create a sustainable mesocosm/ ecosystem?

# Set Up

**Due Wednesday 5/27**
The following site may help with the setup of your mesocosm:

You should consider these questions before setting up either aquatic or terrestrial mesocosms.
Large glass jars are ideal but transparent plastic containers could also be used.
Should the sides of the container be transparent or opaque?
Which type of container will trap more heat?
Which type of container will provide a better seal?
Which of these groups of organisms must be included to make up a sustainable community: autotrophs, consumers, saprotrophs and detritivores?
How many organisms should be included from each group?
How can we ensure that oxygen supply is sufficient for all the organisms in the mesocosm as once it is sealed?
Oxygen should not be able to enter, and carbon dioxide or water should not escape.
How can we prevent any organisms suffering as a result of being placed in the mesocosm?
What kind of information will you need to research about the tolerances of each organism that you plan to use?

Here are some components you should consider while planning your mesocosm:
**Soil** – The productivity of soil depends on mineral content, drainage, water-­‐holding capacity, air spaces, biota (animals present e.g. larvae) and the potential to hold organic matter.

**Seeds/plants** – As you have a limited growing space, your plants will need to be small. There will be a limited selection of seeds from the lab, or you can see what is available to purchase.

**Organic matter** – A mix of leaves, grass, and easily decomposed food such as fruit (do not include citrus fruit or peelings) could be used but you should think carefully about what proportion of each of these components you should use.

**Invertebrate Organisms** – Insects such as fruit flies and larvae can help decompose the detritus.

**Organisms** – Invertebrates could be used in your mesocosm, but you should be careful to select them carefully, and limit the number of larger organisms in this chamber. Vertebrate organisms should be AVOIDED if possible. Add only the number of consumers that the chamber will support.

**Water** – Tap water may be treated with chemicals and so should not be used in the aquatic chamber. What would be a good source of water?

**Substrate** – You should put gravel or sand at the bottom of this chamber. Organisms you put in this chamber may need this substrate as part of their life cycle, or as a refuge.

# Data Gathering:

You will need to record data 2‐3 times a week. In addition you must take **pictures** along with your **written qualitative and quantitative observations**.
You must record data for a **minimum of 2 weeks**.

_**If the mesocosm fails within a few days**, start over with another idea (it is not an excuse to stop doing the assignment)_

Each observation should include:
The **date** of your observations.
The **number of days** the ecosystem has been running.
**Qualitative observations** (e.g. decomposition rate, turbidity of water, and status of the species present).
**Quantitative observation** (e.g. plant height and numbers of organisms)

# Additional observations

you can include the following if you have the materials to do so:
**pH of the soil/water** ‐ You can do a before and after test since the mesocosm is sealed.
**Temperature** – You can use a stick-on thermometer sold at most aquarium stores or record ambient room temperature.
**Dissolved oxygen content of the aquatic chamber** – You can do a before and after test since the mesocosm is sealed. Be aware! The chemicals for this test are hazardous and expensive!
**Additional measurements** (e.g. Analysis of nutrients – NPK content, etc) – You can do a before and after test since the mesocosm is sealed. Most aquarium stores sell cheap dip-­‐strip kits that will give a good analysis of relevant nutrients.
