         <h3>What is a mesocosm and what are they used for?</h3>
         <p>
            A mesocosm is an enclosed enviornment that is commonly used in
            laboratories to investigate how parts of ecosystem interact with one
            another (Odum). Multiple mesocosms <i>can</i> be used simultaneously
            in order to see how individual parts interact with the ecosystem. One
            example of these individually-observed parts is chemicals in
            freshwater (Crossland & La Point).
         </p>
         <h3>What elements are needed to create a sustainable mesocosm?</h3>
         <p>
            Since an ecosystem usually cannot sustain itself without producers,
            they are necesscary for a sustainable mesocosm. H<sub>2</sub>O
            (water), sunlight, and CO<sub>2</sub> are essential for the plant to
            perform photosynthesis (Crossland & La Point). Consumers are not
            needed to provide CO<sub>2</sub> to producers since producers can use
            CO<sub>2</sub> for aerobic respiration. Water does not need to be
            added since the O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) from photosynthesis will bond
            with the hydrogen in the jar to form more water to be recycled.
         </p>
         <p>
            Water, oxygen, and the necessary vitamins and minerals are essential
            for consumers (Lavelle). Since Oxygen and water is already in the
            mesocosm, consumers can be added if the necessary vitamins and
            minerals are present.
         </p>

         <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
         <p>
            If my mesocosm has water, sunlight, and a plant, it will be able to
            sustain itself because the plant will be able to survive in that
            enviornment. If I add a non-producer and nutrient-rich elements to the
            mesocosm, the mesocosm will still be able to sustain itself because
            both the plant and the consumer will be able to sustain themselves.
         </p>
         <h3>Variables</h3>
         <p>
            The amount of sunlight, water, nutrients the soil, and CO<sub>2</sub>
            will be independent variables. The organism's growth and survival will
            be the dependent variables.

         <h3>
            Original Design that Lasted Less Than a Day (Soda Bottle / First
            Attempt)
         </h3>
         <p>
            I filled a 2000 cm<sup>3</sup> water bottle with about 3 to 4 'puffy'
            dandelion heads (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>), about 500 cm<sup>3</sup>
            of soil, an unmeasured amount of water, and about four earthworms (<i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>). I chose
            these materials under the assumption that the producer, or
            the dandelion seeds would grow and still be able to provide the worms
            oxygen. The majority of worms were not able to survive in these
            conditions and ended up surfacing by the first day.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is likely that the dandelions would have grown eventually since
            they did have water, sunlight, and CO<sub>2</sub>. I figured it would
            not be ethical and wait a little longer to see if the dandelions would
            grow while the earthworms are still in the bottle, suffocating.
         </p>

         <h3>We be Thriving Bois ðŸ¤© (Mason Jar / Second Attempt)</h3>
         <p>
            I decided to use a mason jar. About 22.09 cm<sup>3</sup> of moss (<i>Thuidium delicatulum</i>) was placed on
            a 198.8cm<sup>3</sup> layer of soil (Series). Some
            water and an earthworm (<i>Lumbricus terrestris</i>) was added to the
            jar before it was closed. I chose to use these organisms because they
            were native to my area, meaning there was a high chance that they
            would be able to survive under similar conditions, such as the soil
            conditions, within the jar.

         <p>
            Since the producer in this ecosystem is already living, it will be
            able to produce oxygen in the ecosystem from the beginning, meaning
            the earthworm is more likely to live.

            In the beginning of the experiment, the moss was a yellow-green color
            before shifting between bright green and yellowish colors. An
            abundance of dead moss ferns were present by the end of the
            experiment.
         </p>
         <p>
            Condensation was almost always found in the mesocosm, forming beads of
            varying sizes.
         </p>
         <p>
            The soil almost always seemed moderately moist, but had a few large
            dry spots and small nooks in the middle of the layer.

            As the moss volume increased over time, the soil volume seemed to
            decrease over time. This could mean that the moss is putting pressure
            on the soil as it is growing, causing the soil to become compact and
            take up less volume.

         Disscussion & Conclusion
      </h2>
      <div class="dropdown-content" id="d5">
         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>
            The hypothesis is partially supported by the data. The plant appeared
            to survive in an enviornment with sunlight and water; however, it
            could not be determined whether or not the worm was able to survive
            with water, nutrients, and oxygen. It is uncertain whether or not the
            plant survived completely since there were some dying ferns appearent
            by the end of the experiment. The precieved survival of the moss could
            be attributed to the water and sunlight present since the amount of
            CO<sub>2</sub> could not be measured. Given that the plant did survive
            to an extent, the outcome was partially by research since it was able
            to survive with the resources used.
         </p>
         <h3>Limitations</h3>
         <p>
            My data collection methods were limited since I did not measure
            information such as the temperature of the jar and the initial amount
            of water I put into the jar, what nutrients were actually found in the
            soil, etc. This may have affected my experiment because it may have
            provided me with information that explains the moss's color changes.
            This could be avoided by making sure to have materials or methods for
            these measurements before the experiment takes place. In the future, I
            may stick a thermometer inside the mesocosm, measure the water before
            and after the experiment, and consider purchasing a nutrient analysis
            kit to use before and after the experiment.
         </p>
         <p>
            Another limitation was my inability to see whether or not the worm was
            still present. This affected my experiment because it prevented me
            from actually figuring out whether or not my mesocosm was sustainable
            for non-producer organisms. this limitation could be avoided by
            reserving an area for the worm to live in or use a smaller container.
            By giving the worm a smaller space, it will be easier to determine
            whether or not it is living.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was limited to experimenting with one kind of ecosystem. This has
            little affect on the current experiment, but it prevents me from
            knowing how sustainable other ecosystems are in mesocosms. I could
            avoid this by using different abiotic and biotic factors in future
            mesocosm experiments.
         </p>
         <p>
            The jar's shape was a limitation since it did make the moss difficult
            to see sometimes. This is fairly important since it directly concerns
            qualitative plant data. To avoid this in the future, I would use a
            container that did not limit what could be seen clearly.
